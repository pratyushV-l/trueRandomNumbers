## Factors that Influence Randomness In a PC
  - **CPU Uptime:**
      This is a major factor, especially as it is propabably an individual aspect of every computer, essentially giving them a unique seed to base the random number on.
  - **Keyboard Timing:**
      Easiest way to get randomness factor from user, it also just adds more randomness
  - **Psuedo Random Number Generator:**
      This method, allows me to input a seed(all my other random factors) and generate another number from it, basically encoding the number further, contributing to randomness.
