# trueRandomNumbers
An actually random number generator

## Some Backstory...
I recently read about how CloudFlare(An international security company) needed a solution for getting random input for their traffic generators. This lead me down a rabbit-hole of random number generators, particularly in computing, as I figured out it is impossible to truly generate random numbers just by algorithms. I learned, that in modern times, there are external factors(such as radiation in the air) to assist in calculating random numbers! I wanted to replicate this for those of us who don't have radiation sensors lying around, bringing us to this project.

## The Project
I want to make a python-flask web app, that takes in random inputs from the user(from various factors), allowing for the perfect local, random number generator!
